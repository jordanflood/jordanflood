# Hey There 👋

I'm Jordan. I'm a **Data Analyst** transitioning into Quality Assurance after a background in Sales and Data Analytics. I’m currently focused on building a strong foundation in software testing and Development combining structured learning (ISTQB), hands-on practice, and a growing understanding of how software systems are designed and built. My long-term goal is to work as a QA Engineer who understands both business needs and technical systems.


🎯 *Career Transition*

- 📈 Sales → strong communication, stakeholder focus, and user perspective

- 📊 Data Analytics → analytical thinking, attention to detail, working with data

- 🧪 Now pursuing QA → quality, testing mindset, and software reliability

This path gives me a unique advantage: I test software not just for bugs, but for real user impact

🧪 Currently Learning (QA Focus)

- Software testing fundamentals

- Test design techniques (black-box, boundary values, equivalence partitioning)

- Manual testing & exploratory testing

- Bug reporting & defect lifecycle

- Agile & Scrum workflows
